                    which one is able to see himself and the world around him.

                    Life becomes valueless without education. Education makes one self reliant and develops ones self

    <p class="sectiontag text-big">EDUCATION IN INDIA</p>
    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">A major shift in the education system can be observed since the pre and post-British rule till today in India. Initially, children were educated in Gurukuls which was later modified and the modern education system was introduced. 

        After India became independent, the constitution committed six fundamental rights, of which one was the Right to Education. It allowed free education for every child up between the age of 6 and 14 years. 
        
        The education system is mainly divided into pre-primary, primary, elementary and secondary education, which is followed by higher studies. India has made great strides in improving access to quality education, increasing elementary school enrollment and reducing the number of out-of-school children.

        These achievements have been bolstered by key laws, policies and programmes such as the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act (2009), the National Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Policy (2013). However, challenges do remain.
        
        An estimated 6.1 million children out of school in 2014 reduced from 13.46 million in 2006. Out of 100 students, 29 per cent of girls and boys drop out of school before completing the full cycle of elementary education, and often they are the most marginalised children. (Source: SRI-IMRB Surveys, 2009 and 2014)
        
        Around 50 per cent of adolescents do not complete secondary education, while approximately 20 million children not attending pre-school. (Source Rapid Survey of Children 2013-2014 MWCD)

    <p class="sectiontag text-big">EDUCATION REFORMS</p>
    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education reform is the name given to the goal of changing public education. The meaning and education methods have changed through debates over what content or experiences result in an educated individual or an educated society. Historically, the motivations for reform have not reflected the current needs of society. A consistent theme of reform includes the idea that large systematic changes to educational standards will produce social returns in citizens' health, wealth, and well-being.Theories on educational reform have been current since Greco–Roman times, in all three directions of reforms related to school, life, and society. Reform movements in the Middle Ages initially occurred on the basis of religious motives, above all where deviations from church doctrines were associated with an alternative practice. Heresy always suggested new education, because the divergences from the main doctrine picked out alternative forms of salvation as a central theme, to which the life of an own group had to be adapted..</p>
